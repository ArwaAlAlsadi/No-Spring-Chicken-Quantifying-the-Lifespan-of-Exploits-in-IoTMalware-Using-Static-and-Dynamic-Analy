This repository contains 4 categories:

1- Datasets
This category contains all the three IoT binaries datasets used in this research. 
	- URLhaus: IoT binaries collected from July 2020 to October 2020.
	- Honeypot: IoTPot honeypot for collecting binaries from September2018 to August 2020
	- Genealogy: Binaries collected from Virustoutal between January 2015 and August 2018 [https://github.com/eurecom-s3/tangled_iot/tree/master/dataset]

2- Clustering
	- The clusters of vhash used to cluster URLhaus and Honeypot datasets to conduct the static analysis. 
	- Also, we included the BinDiff tool we used to including the codes and the generated graphs.

3- Exploit search
This category contains:
	- CSV file with all the exploit codes found during the static and dynamic analysis conducted on the URLhaus and Honeypot datasets mapped to their vulnerability, vulnerability publish date, type of vulnerability, device manufacturing, targeted device, exploit example, exploit publish date, vulnerability reference, exploit reference 
	- Exploit signatures: a csv file includes all the exploit codes found and the signature we generated for each one.
	- Exploit search script: the script we used to extract strings from binaries from the Genealogy dataset, search for exploits using the signatures, and finally map them with their vulnerability and the rest the information using the file above.

4- Network artefacts
The PCAPs collected during the dynamic analysis of both the URLhaus and Honeypot datasets to extract exploit codes.
